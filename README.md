# gds_phuncs

Library of functions for making a integrated photonic device GDS. Adapted from https://code.harvard.edu/haw714/writegds, and mainly based on the phidl package.

To install this package, clone the repository, then use command line to navigate to the folder that contains setup.py and use the command

pip install -e .

This will install in development mode, so any changes made to the modules in qd_lasing_dynamics will take effect immediately.
